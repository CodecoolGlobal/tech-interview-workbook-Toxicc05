# Web with Python questions

## Software design

### Clean code

#### Point out 5 suggestions, how to format an SQL query!
* Separate your query into multiple lines.
* Capitalize keywords such as "WHERE, HAVING, SELECT" for better readability.
* Use "AS" to rename columns when needed for a prettier display.
* Choose either cammel-case or underscore when naming objects, but never both.
*
#### What layers can you name in a simple web application?
* Front-end (What happens on the user's computer.)
* Back-end (What happens on the server's side.)
* Data storage and access (Usually SQL Datbase, or CSV file.)
### Error handling
#### What error can occur, when an array does not have an element on the requested index?
* If the requested index is bigger than the length of the array, then an index error occurs.
* Else, the program runs as it would normally, however, the returned value vill be empty.
#### What is the “finally” block, and how would you use it?
* The finally block is part of a try-except block.
* A try-except block is used to catch special exceptions types in a program.
* The finally block runs once the try-except block has finished it's tasks. 
#### Why should we catch special exception types?
*
### Security
#### What is SQL injection? How to protect an application against it?
* SQL injection is a code injection technique in which a client inserts malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution.
* Fields prone to SQL injection attacks are always using POST methods to communicate with the server.
* example: Hello, my name is'); DROP DATABASE users;
#### What is XSS? How to protect an application against it?
* XSS, Cross-Site-Scripting is a security breach which takes advantage of dynamically generated webpages.
* An XSS attack happens when a client injects malicious third party scripts into a dynamically generated website.
* Most common script types include: Javascript, VBNScript, HTML, Perl, C++, and most notably, Flash.
* Via XSS, the client is able to: highjack accounts, change user settings, and/or poison cookies with malicious code.
#### How to properly store passwords?
* Password should be stored after put through a hashing (encoding) algorithm for increased security.
#### What is HTTPS?
* Secure, encripted Hyper Text Transport Protocol connection handler.
* A modern, more secure connection handler that encrypts the requests between the client and the server.
#### What is encryption and decryption?
* Encryption is the process of encoding information.
* During encryption, the information, known as plain text is transformed into an alternative form, known as cypher text.
* Encryption algorithms usually use a pseudo-random encryption key, generated by an algorithm.
* Decyphering the information without posessing the encryption key is possible, but is much-much harder.
* Decryption is the process of transforming cypher text back into it's original, plain text form.
* In ideal circumstances only authorized parties are able to decrypt the encrypted cypher texts.
#### What is hashing?
* Hashing algorithms are used to map data of any size into a fixed size hash value.
#### What is the difference between encryption and hashing? When would you use which?
* Hashing is useful to validate data by looking at changes in the hashed value.
* Encryption is useful for encoding data to maintain confidentiality.
#### What encryption methods do you know?
* Symmetric: A single private key is used to encode the information.
* Assymmetric: A public and a private key is used to encode the information. 
* -The private key is held by the user and the private key is held by the company. 
* -Both keys are needed to decypher the information.
#### What hashing methods do you know?
*
#### How/where would you store sensitive data (like db password, API key, ...) of your application?
*
## Computer science

### Algorithms

#### What is the difference between Stack and Queue data structure?
* Stacks follow a first in, last out principle, meaning the last element inserted will be returned first.
* Elements can only be inserted at the first place of the stack. This element is then tracked as the top.
* Queues follow a first in first out principle, meaning the first element inserted is the first to get returned.
* Elements can only be added at the rear (end) of the queue.
#### What is BubbleSort? Describe the main logic of this sorting algorithm.
* Bubble sorting works by repeatedly swapping the adjesent elements of a list if they are in the wrong order.
* The sorting algorithm has to go through the list without changing any element to know that it's sorted.
#### Explain the process of finding the maximum and minimum value in a list of numbers!
* Because lists are in an orderly manner, we pick the first (minimum) and last (maximum) element of the list and return them.
#### Explain the process of calculating the average value in an array of numbers!
* We iterate over every item in the array, add them together, then divide the result by the length of the array.
#### What is Big O complexity? Explain time and space complexity!
*
#### Explain the process of calculating the average value in a list of numbers!
* Because lists are in an orderly manner, we take the first and last element of the list, add them together, then divide the result by 2.

### HTML & CSS

#### What’s the difference between XML, XHTML and HTML?
#### How to include a JavaScript file in a webpage?
* Via the <script/> html tag. 
* Javascript can either be written into the HTML in between the <script/> tags or a javascript file can be allocated with the src parameter.
* examples: <script> return 'asd' </script>, <script src="/asd/javascript.js"/>
#### How to include a CSS file in a webpage?
* Either by writing it into the html file between  <style/> tags or via linking the stylesheet at the beggining of the html file.
* examples: <style> .asd { border-color: black; } </style>, <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/css/asd.css">
#### How to select an element using its id in CSS?
* By using a "#" before the id name.
* example: '#asd' refers to the html element with the "asd" id.
#### How to select elements using their class in CSS?
* By putting a "." before the class name.
* example: '.asd' refers to the html element with the "asd" class.
#### How to select elements which have the ‘alpha’ and ‘beta’ classes in CSS?
* By putting the alpha and beta classes next to each other, separated by a dot.
* example: ".alpha.beta {color: red;}" will color every html element that has the "alpha" alpha class and the "beta" beta class to be red.
#### How to select all list items in all ordered lists on the page in CSS?
* By refering to the html elements by tag name.
* example: "ol {color: red;}" will color all elements in the ordered list to be red.
#### How to select elements using their attributes in CSS?
* By putting the attribute in square brackets after the target's tag name.
* example: "a[target] {color: red;}" will color all html elements red if they have the "target" attribute.
#### What are UX and UI?
* UI stands for User Interface. UI concerns the appearance an the interactable elemnts of the application.
* UX stands for User Experience. UX concerns the overall user experience including usability, functionality, design, and engineering of the application.
#### Please list some points that an application should fulfill to have good UX.
* It has to be efficient to use and has to use language that the user is familiar with.
* Has to have at least some documentation about common errors and how to fix them.
* Reduce the users reliance on his/her/their memory by not hiding important functions behind multiple menus.
* Users should be informed of what the app/system/product is doing on their device.
#### What is XML, XSLT, DTD?
*
#### What is the difference between HTML and XML?
* HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is used for creating static webpages.
* XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is also used to create webpages, however, XML is used for transporting data, rather then displaying it.
### Javascript

#### What is javascript?
* JavaScript is a high-level, object oriented programming language.
* Javascript is used to control the program behavior of webpages.
* Javascript is often compiled on-the-run when a client loads a webpage.
#### When to use AJAX? Bring examples of its usage.
* We use AJAX when we want to send or receive data from the server to the client without reloading the page.
#### What is DOM and how to manipulate it from Javascript?
* DOM stands for Document Oject Model for html and XML.
* DOM represents the document structure, and style, content.
* Javascript uses DOM objects to manipulate a page, to add/remove/or modify elements to/of a page.
* Individual elements can be made variable of in Javascript by using "document.getElementById('id')" or similar built in functions.
* New DOM elements can be created via "document.createElement('')" function, which then can be added by using "element.appendChild(newStuff)".
#### What are events and how/why to use them in Javascript?
* Events are acting as triggers for certain functions in a javascript code.
* Events can also be used as targets to target DOM elements in a Javascript function via "event.target"
* examples for events: "click", "dragover", "dragstart", "dragend"
#### What is event bubbling/capturing? How would you use it?
*
#### What is JSON and how do we use it?
* JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
* JSON is an open standard  file format and data interchange format.
* JSON files and data consist of key-value pairs but are not to be mistaken with DICT objects.
* JSON data can be used to communicate with the server using JavaScript.
* JSON data can be used to deliver data to and from the server without the need of reloading the webpage.
* JSON files can be used to store settings in applications.
## Software engineering

### Version control

#### What type of branching strategy would you use?
* I would make a different branch for every task that is not closely related and name the branches according to the task.
#### What would you do if you find a bug on the production code (master branch)?
*
#### How can you move changes from one branch to another in GIT?
* By creating pull requests and merging the two branches that I want.
#### How does a VCS help with code reviews?
*
#### What is your favorite git command? Why?
* Commit, because when I'm using it, it means that I've progressed with my tasks.
#### What does remote/local mean in Git? 
* Local means files and changes that are only on your computer and are not shared.
* Remote are the files and changes that are shared between every collaborator in the project.

### DevOps

#### Why is it good to use a package manager software?
* Installing softwares are made way easier by their existence.
* With package managers, you are able to roll back to previous versions of programs with ease.
#### Why is it good to use a virtual environment for a project?
* Runtime enviroment updates can break programs when done due to differing syntaxes.
* With virtual enviroments you can make sure that the projects enviroment stays the same as in the beggining, even if you upgrade your main runtime enviroment.
